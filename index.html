    li:Syaoran Li is a member of the Li Clan and is a descendant of Clow Reed, the creator of the Clow Cards. Clow Reed has a mixed heritage of English and Chinese as his father was English and his mother was Chinese and due to his heritage, Clow Reed created a special combination of magic of both western and Chinese magic together. The Li family are from Clow Reed's mother side of the family and one of the few remaining magical families in the world and live in Hong Kong, China. Since his childhood, Syaoran has spent his whole life, training and studying to one day become the new master of the Clow Cards, believing he is the rightful future owner since he is a descendant of Clow Reed. Syaoran lives with his mother and older sisters, but his father died and Syaoran never knew him.

Syaoran is also close with his cousin, Meiling Li. Since childhood, Syaoran and Meiling grew up together as they lived close to one another and both trained in martial arts, but originally weren't very close due to Syaoran's serious demeanour. However, Syaoran and Meiling later grew very close when Syaoran managed to find and locate Meiling's pet bird that was set free. Ever since, Meiling has been in love with Syaoran due to his kind and caring gesture and Meiling officially declares Syaoran and herself are engaged to be married. However, Syaoran doesn't return Meiling's feelings and while he is annoyed by her constant show of affections, he doesn't object to the engagement due to special promise they made in their early childhood.

Years later, when the Clow Cards were set free from the Clow Book after being led dormant for years, Syaoran learned of the events and decided to leave Hong Kong and travelled to Tomeda, Japan to capture the Clow Cards and officially become their new master. Syaoran travels to Tomeda alongside his family butler while his mother, sisters and Meiling remain in Hong Kong. <br><br><br>
    sakura : Sakura Kinomoto is the main protagonist of the series and is Syaoran's main love interest. In the beginning of the series, Syaoran is extremely antagonistic towards Sakura, spawned from his belief that they should compete for the cards to see who is worthy of wielding them. On his first day at Sakura's school, before he even knows her name, he glares hatefully at her, causing her to worry. During recess, he proceeded to say she was hopeless as the cards' holder and physically attacked her in an attempt to steal them but was thwarted by Toya and Yukito. This was the start of a rocky relationship between the two for some time.

Syaoran would ignore Sakura and reject her constant attempts to befriend him, seeing her as nothing more than a rival. Despite this, he does at times save her in critical moments and provides her with information about the cards. This and trying to capture the cards at the same time, gradually allows the two to learn to work together and they build a friendship that Syaoran doesn't fully recognize until halfway through the series. In episode 27, he blushes when Sakura hugs him and the following episodes show him being shy around her and growing increasingly worried for her safety and well-being, something that confuses him.

After the Final Judgment, Sakura is declared the new master of the Clow Cards, leaving Syaoran, essentially, a failure. However, he congratulates her and even smiles for her, showing his respect for her. At the start of the third season, Syaoran plans on returning home to Hong Kong, China now that Sakura is the official mistress of the cards, but he promises to visit her someday. Then, newcomer Eriol Hiiragizawa comes from the United Kingdom and starts charming Sakura, much to Syaoran's dismay and disgust. When Sakura becomes quite sad that Syaoran is leaving, decided to extend his stay in Tomoeda. This was because, quoted by Tomoyo "a new rival" has appeared so going back to Hong Kong has been put off for a while".

At this point in the series, Syaoran's feelings toward Sakura have slowly changed from that of rivalry to that of an elementary school crush. Sakura's consistently cheerful attitude and warm smiles cause more and more blushes on Syaoran's cheeks. Much to his surprise, Syaoran finds himself jealous over the fact that Eriol is getting too close to Sakura. As he becomes more aware of his deep feelings for her, his denial over the romantic nature of them also increases. However, with advice from Yue and Tomoyo, he eventually accepts that he indeed loves Sakura and wants to be with her. He tries to confess to her several times, but something always happens. After Sakura confesses to Yukito and is rejected, Syaoran comforts her and assures her that she will find the person she truly deeply loves. While he feels grateful at being able to help her, he is worried that his true romantic feelings for her will be a burden to her and is troubled of whether or not to tell her. Tomoyo manages to convince him that if he does confess, Sakura will really think about it and give him her answer.
